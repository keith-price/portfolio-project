				This React app was created to fetch data from NASA's APOD API. Each
				daily image is displayed with its title and description. It seemed a
				shame to then lose this incredible image when it is replaced the
				following day. So an archive page was created where users can
				browse previous APOD images and their related information. After
				fetching the data each day, the daily image along with its title and
				description are written to a database collection. That collection can
				be viewed as image cards on the archive page. Selecting an image then
				opens up the archive detail page with the image displayed in full
				along with its title and description.

			<p class="about-description">
				Computers have been in my life for as long as I can remember. As a kid I made text-based adventure games on my Commodore C16. However, I always thought programming was for geniuses and I initailly pursued a different path in life. I now realize that programming is for determined, creative, curious people who enjoy problem solving. So far I am 100% self-taught and have been able to build good foundational skills with JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I am also very intrigued by coding languages in general and have experimented with Python, C#, C++, Rust and Go. The next step - mentorship. There is so much to learn and the goal is to find the right company where I can grow as a developer, learn from more experienced team members and make a meaningful contribution.
