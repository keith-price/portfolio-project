				This React app was created to fetch data from NASA's APOD API. Each
				daily image is displayed with its title and description. It seemed a
				shame to then lose this incredible image when it is replaced the
				following day. So an archive page was created where users can
				browse previous APOD images and their related information. After
				fetching the data each day, the daily image along with its title and
				description are written to a database collection. That collection can
				be viewed as image cards on the archive page. Selecting an image then
				opens up the archive detail page with the image displayed in full
				along with its title and description.

				Keith Price makes things with JavaScript. A little
				while back he dove headfirst into a sea of code, completely unprepared
				and with no idea what to do. Luckily he survived and swam back to shore with a solid understanding of the
				fundemantals of programming in JavaScript and the desire to make a career as a
				developer. After discovering Three.js a whole world of creative
				possibilities opened up before him and he now spends his time learning how
				to make 3D interactive web content. Game development is also of great
				interest to him and he can be found late at night with C# and the Unity game
				engine trying to bring ideas to life.
