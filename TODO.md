1. Need to add content first before dealing with the details and functionality

2. After clicking on menu item, page should slow scroll to relevant section

3. Goal - particle trail from mouse cursor (also maybe custom mouse cursor)
4. As user moves through the app section by section the camera should move to focus on different elements (Earth, Moon, ISS)

5. Need to a an extra feature (button) "Want to ride on the ISS?" after pressing the camera attached to the ISS so the user can view follow it around the Earth. Also need a button to go back to the regular view.
6. Once all the functionality is in place - focus on getting the layout (responsive), typeface, font sizes, colors right.

7. Add audio, with the ability for the user to browse page with audio or not.
8. Add camera sway on mouse move. Subtle effect, just enough for the user to notice.

9. Possible particle drip/drops from navmenu after click, particles can drop off the screen (If collide with moon they react)

# 10) Finish site and then look into having the site content, text, image to link to app, as part of the Three canvas so they can be interacted with.
